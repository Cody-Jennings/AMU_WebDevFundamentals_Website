    <h1>A little bit about the author <em>Cody Jennings</em>.</h1>

    <p>The author, Cody, enjoys many things but also does not need alot to be content and happy. He enjoys spending time
        with his wife and 4 dogs, all whom live inside. Three of the four dogs are rescues. The oldest Jax was brought
        by Cody into the relationship, he is 9 and is a lemon beagle/red tick coon hound mix. Cody's wife brought Buddy
        and Elmer (both rescues) into the relationship. Buddy the second oldest is 7-8 and he is a pocket beagle, Elmer
        is 4-5 and is a 12 inch beagle. While engaged, they rescued their final dog Gunner, who is 3-4 and a pit/lab
        mix. They love hiking on the trails and enjoy the mountain views. All four dogs were part of the wedding and
        even had dog tuxedos while escorting four of the groomsmen down the aisle. </p>
    <p>Cody enjoys many activities outdoors and indoors alike. Videogames, anime, boardgames, bouldering(indoor
        rock-climbing) and playing cards are some of his favorite indoor activities. Outdoor activities include, riding
        his Harley-Davidson, scuba-diving, floating down the river, fishing, paintbull, target shooting. Some additional
        activities the author wishes to pursue is archery, Brazilian Jui Jitsu/Krav Maga, reloading ammunition. Cody
        enjoys having a garden every year and would love to start a homestead.</p>
    <p>Cody enjoys problem-solving and critical thinking. Breaking down machinery when it needs repairing or even
        preventive maintenance. Cody grew up playing videogames and finds programming fascinating now that he has had a
        taste. Perhaps one day he may get skilled enough to pursue in creation of the next big gaming series!</p>
    <p>The author does not engage in as many civic activities or even the activities listed above as much as he would
        like due to school and work. To this day besides a few years of being overseas deployed, he has donated blood
        every chance he could since age 17. Cody has donated 36 pints, a little over 4 1/2 gallons of blood! Cody has
        also voted every chance available, even while deployed and working in other states.</p>
